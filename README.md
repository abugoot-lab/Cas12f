# PLM based Low-N protein engineering model
This is the official github repo for Jiang et al (2024). There are two python files that you can adapt and run on customize protein sequences. topmodel.py is an ensemble model between esm1b embeddings and a ridge regression model. Cluster_protein.py is used for the analysis of protein mutational trajectory. Esm1b.yml is a conda environment configuration file for running these codes.
